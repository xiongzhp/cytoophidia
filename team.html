                      Chris has joined forces with the Liu lab in Shanghai, as a senior PostDoc since October 2016. His current research interests focus on mechanisms behind the formation and regulation of cytoophidia in fission yeast. He completed his undergraduate studies in Biology at IMBB, University of Crete (Greece), from where he also obtained his MSc and PhD in Molecular Biology and Biomedicine, studying transcriptional regulation in budding yeast. He then moved to UCL, London, where he worked as a Research Assistant on projects related to the experimental evolution of gene regulation in fission yeast. His first PostDoc at Oxford University was in the field of DNA replication in S. pombe. Apart from science, he is also passionate about photography, he is an avid traveler, a film buff and enjoys having fun with friends.

                    Lydia completed her PhD at the University of Sheffield with Professor Goldman. Her research focused on how the Srs2 helicase influences template choice between the homologous chromosome and the sister chromatid during meiotic double-strand break repair. Then she worked as a postdoctoral researcher for Dr. Humphrey at the University of Oxford, studying the correlation between resection and de-novo telomere addition in different rqh1∆ backgrounds. Now she is working on how cytoophidia formation is regulated. In her spare time, Lydia appreciates being outdoors, music, traveling, reading, and yoga.

Andy started in Oxford in October 2010. Prior to this, he studied in Cambridge for a while, doing his PhD with Andrew Travers at the LMB studying the role of chromatin remodelling factors and SUMOylation in heterochromatin formation in flies. After spending a few years working with small RNAs in unicellular green algae with David Baulcombe, he moved to the FGU to study the role of longer RNA molecules in flies. When not in the lab, he enjoys ski touring, classic road rallies (and associated tinkering with old cars) and travelling.

Mickey came on the scene in April 2010 when he decided to do a research project in the lab as part of his Medicine FHS course in Oxford University. His project focused on effect of stress on the organisation of cytoplasmic organelles named U body and P body using the Drosophila reproductive system as a model. Mickey is hugely interested in genetics and molecular biology but has always wanted to be a paediatrician in the future - dream is to work in Great Ormond Street Hospital! In his spare time, he loves hanging out with friends and watching Taiwanese TV programmes.

Connie is a fourth year medical student from Imperial College in London and started working in the lab this summer. She has transformed from a naive Drosophila lab newbie to a finely skilled scientist. She has learnt many important things such as how to differentiate male/female flies and dissecting brains from larvae (though not sure of the relevance of those to medicine). The project on cytoophidia has been very exciting but at times a little stressful, she hopes to return to the lab one day as a qualified doctor and save the human race from cancer and obesity. Her hobbies are painting, travelling and cooking.

James did his PhD looking at the relationship between exercise and blood levels of BDNF (a protein linked to protection against neurological disease). After realising that molecular biology is what really excites him and gets him up in the morning James has been learning the trade in various labs over the last 2 years. He joins us on the cytoophidium project. In his spare time James can usually be found riding a road bike or playing the drums.

Siân joined the group in October 2008 after finishing a degree in Biochemistry at Exeter College, Oxford. She is currently investigating how the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein is regulated in fruit flies. Siân was born in Swansea and thinks the best things in life are songs by Cole Porter, English Breakfast tea, handmade cheeses, period dramas and all things Italian. She generally only listens to music made pre-1970 and likes listening to Radio 4 comedy in the fly room.

Josh started in the lab in May 2010 for an 8-week research project for his Medicine FHS course. The work involves looking at the phenotypic changes associated with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in Drosophila. Although not expecting a Nobel Prize he hopes this work will spark an interest in research which he will pursue later in life. When not working (a rare occurrence in Oxford) he likes to indulge in all manors of sports, rugby, hockey, kickboxing and rowing.

Lin started her PhD in October 2004 and passed her viva in January 2009. During this time, she focused on the role of SMN in Drosophila oogenesis in order to ascertain its role in RNA metabolism, which is likely to be important in the neuronal system. Lin has a real interest in travel and learning about other cultures, so is currently in Beijing teaching English while trying to learn Chinese. To keep up to date with the scientific community she is also editing scientific articles for content and grammatical correctness before they are sent for review to international journals.

Mohima is excited to be joining the lab while studying here at Oxford. No stranger to identifying flies and extracting confocal data, Mohima has been working in a fruit fly lab since she began college, and is eager to dive into learning about the budding area of cytoophidia research. At home, she is a second-year undergraduate at the College of William and Mary, studying Biology and Cognitive Science (a self-designed major she affectionately calls “Neuro-anthro-linguistics”). She hopes to use the unique perspective granted by her majors to do work in the field of international medicine and relief, and is following a Pre-Medicine track. Eager to reinforce her desire to be in multiple places at once, Mohima also tries her hand at spontaneous jam sessions with (ridiculously talented) student musicians, dancing about campus with good friends, and trying to meet all the wonderful personalities that make Oxford truly beautiful.

                    Sanjay’s primary research interest lies in understanding the molecular basis of RNA function in regulating cellular processes during animal development. Sanjay received my PhD from Jadavpur University, India. For his postdoctoral studies, he joined Dr. Anne Ephrussi's laboratory at EMBL, Heidelberg, to study the role of nuclear processing events in determining cytoplasmic localization of transcripts during Drosophila oogenesis. He also examined the roles of translation initiation factors during Drosophila spermatogenesis in Prof. Paul Lasko's laboratory at McGill University, Montreal, uncovering their distinct roles during gamete formation. In the laboratory of Professor Liu, Sanjay was investigating the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology.
